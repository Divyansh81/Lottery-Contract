Lottery Smart Contract
This Ethereum smart contract implements a simple lottery system where participants can enter the lottery by sending a minimum contribution of 0.01 ether. The manager, who deploys the contract, has the ability to pick a winner randomly from the participants.

Contract Details
Contract Address (on Testnet): [Provide the deployed contract address on a testnet]
Solidity Version: 0.8.0
Getting Started
Prerequisites
Ensure you have an Ethereum development environment set up.
Use a tool like Remix or Truffle for compiling and deploying the smart contract.
Deployment
Deploy the contract to a local blockchain or a testnet.
The manager, who is the deployer of the contract, can then interact with it.
Participant Entry
Participants can enter the lottery by calling the enter function and sending a minimum contribution of 0.01 ether.
Picking a Winner
Only the manager can pick a winner by calling the pickWinner function.
The winner is selected randomly from the pool of participants, and the entire contract balance is transferred to the winner.

Security Considerations

Consider additional security measures based on the specific use case and deployment environment.
